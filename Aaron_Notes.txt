Motor Sizing Program
--------------------
Using OpenMDAO to optimize motor geometry based on given parameters and constraints.

Main Goal:
Create more accurate motor sizing code and then cross-check the results with an optimized motor design.

Create different branches in git for different features.
i.e.
- Torque Calculation
- Losses Calculation
-etc

--------------------

Known Issues:
- Flux Density calculation is incorrect
	- Research and fix

- Torque calculation is incorrect
	- Research and fix


Wanted Features:
- Torque vs Speed curve plot

- Efficiency Table (Using Interpolation)
	- Create Table / .csv of motor efficiencies (from Motor-CAD or Python code???)
	- Feedback into motor-sizing program
